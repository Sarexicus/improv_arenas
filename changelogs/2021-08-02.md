# Improv Arenas Changelog
**[2020-08-02] 1.2 - The Advancement Update**

## Lobby Changes
- Added signs atop each lectern showing which book each contains.
  - Fixed structure issue where pages weren't set to page 1 on load. 
- Added sign in team change menu for spectator mode.

## Gameplay Changes
- Removed all vanilla Minecraft advancements while the datapack is loaded.
  - These advancements would reveal what a player had obtained before they would have added it to their ender chest.
  - This extends up to 1.17 for forwards compatibility.
- Added custom advancements.
  - These are all purely-cosmetic side challenges.
  - Some advancements will not work on 1.17 due to combat-snapshot specificity or specification changes since 1.16
- Players on teams now have a custom prefix based on team.
- Added formal spectator team:
  - Places player in spectator for every arena round.
  - Spectator players do not have to be "ready" for rounds to start
  - Currently unfinished feature for admin spectators: `/function improv_arenas:util/echest_spy` 
    - Will display string representation of all items in a player's ender chest.
    - Feature will get some form of UI in a future version (earlier if Mojang decides to add a 1.17-based combat snapshot).

## Backend Changes
- Cleaned up tick functions.
  - Most tick-intensive functions have been moved to backend advancements.
  - This should drastically reduce tick lag in the mode, especially during gameplay.
- Bug fixes:
  - Fixed major issue in previous version where player kills would count as suicides.
  - Fixed issue where dying to a non-entity source would show an incomplete death message.
  - Smoothed issues when attributing "damage leading to death" as actual kills rather than suicides.
    - This fixes fall damage kills, border struggles and lava kills.
